# IMC-Prosperity-3
Repository to store the codes submitted to the [IMC Prosperity 3](https://prosperity.imc.com/) trading challenge.

For the challenge we used   [Jmerle's Prosperity 3 backtester](https://github.com/jmerle/imc-prosperity-3-backtester). The output it generates closely matches the format of the output generated by the official submission environment and is therefore compatible with his [Prosperity 3 Visualizer](https://github.com/jmerle/imc-prosperity-3-visualizer) that we also used as it was very useful how our trading bot interacted with the market. The basic usage can be found in [Jmerle's repository](https://github.com/jmerle/imc-prosperity-3-backtester/blob/master/README.md). We copied the basic usage guide here for simplicity:

## Usage

Basic usage:
```sh
# Install the latest version of the backtester
$ pip install -U prosperity3bt

# Run the backtester on an algorithm using all data from round 0
$ prosperity3bt <path to algorithm file> 0
```

Run `pip install -U prosperity3bt` again when you want to update the backtester to the latest version.

Some more usage examples:
```sh
# Backtest on all days from round 1
$ prosperity3bt example/starter.py 1

# Backtest on round 1 day 0
$ prosperity3bt example/starter.py 1-0

# Backtest on round 1 day -1 and round 1 day 0
$ prosperity3bt example/starter.py 1--1 1-0

# Backtest on all days from rounds 1 and 2
$ prosperity3bt example/starter.py 1 2

# Merge profit and loss across days
$ prosperity3bt example/starter.py 1 --merge-pnl

# Automatically open the result in the visualizer when done
# Assumes your algorithm logs in the visualizer's expected format
$ prosperity3bt example/starter.py 1 --vis

# Write algorithm output to custom file
$ prosperity3bt example/starter.py 1 --out example.log

# Skip saving the output log to a file
$ prosperity3bt example/starter.py 1 --no-out

# Backtest on custom data
# Requires the value passed to `--data` to be a path to a directory that is similar in structure to https://github.com/jmerle/imc-prosperity-3-backtester/tree/master/prosperity3bt/resources
$ prosperity3bt example/starter.py 1 --data prosperity3bt/resources

# Print trader's output to stdout while running
# This may be helpful when debugging a broken trader
$ prosperity3bt example/starter.py 1 --print
